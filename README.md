# Hi there 👋🏿

I'm Esaw Adhana (he/him), currently based in the Seattle, Washington area, and as of fall 2023, I will be enrolled full-time as a Stanford University undergraduate studying computer science (with a focus in artificial intelligence and machine learning).

I'm currently working on my webdev skills, and in the past months, I've become relatively proficient in HTML, CSS, and JS. I hope to practice using jQuery and React as I become more versed in front-end development. Additionally, I have been working on my data structures and algorithms, grinding problems on LeetCode (check out my solutions repository!).

Reach out to me if you have any ideas/questions! Message (and follow) me on LinkedIn (Esaw Adhana) and Instagram (@esaw.adhana)!!!
