# Hi there 👋🏿

I'm Esaw Adhana (he/him), orginally based in the Seattle, Washington area, but as of fall 2023, I am enrolled at Stanford University as an undergraduate studying computer science (with a planned coterminal master's degree in management science and engineering).

I'm currently working on my low-level language skills and hardware, and in the past months, I've become proficient in C++. I hope to practice using C more in the future and ultimately make my own project in one of Stanford's makerspaces. Additionally, I have been working on my data structures and algorithms, grinding problems on LeetCode (check out my solutions repository!).

Reach out to me if you have any ideas/questions! Message (and follow) me on LinkedIn (Esaw Adhana) and Instagram (@esaw.adhana)!!!
