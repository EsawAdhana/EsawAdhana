# Hi there 👋🏿

I'm Esaw Adhana (he/him), and I'm originally from the Seattle area. Currently, I'm a sophomore enrolled at Stanford University, and I'm studying computer science (with a potential coterminal master's degree in management science and engineering).

Reach out to me if you have any ideas/questions! Message (and follow) me on LinkedIn (Esaw Adhana) and Instagram (@esaw.adhana)!
